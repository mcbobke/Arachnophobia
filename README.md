# Arachnophobia
A 2D side-scrolling game filled to the brim with spiders.

This game was created during the 2015 Spring Quarter Game Jam hosted by the Video Game Development Club at UC Irvine. We used Unity 5.0 for development, with C# as the scripting language.

## How to Play
Download the Build folder inside the project folder and run the executable (Windows). Otherwise, clone the project and run the main scene, or build the project for your platform.

Use the A key to move left, D key to move right, and the Space Bar to jump. Jump and land on top of the spiders that spawn to kill them. There are different kinds of spiders that have different characteristics, so be careful! Watch out for the angry king spider...
